This is a class I developed a while back while working on a project of mine and we already know that it’s very effective.
In order to understand what it does you need to first understand how a browser sends a POST request.
When a user submits a form, browser sends something like this to the server:
POST /somepage.php HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: THE LENGTH

username=blah&password=blah&email=some_email
There are 2 problems with this:
1 – Someone along the way can view the password and email address by looking at the packets that are going to the server. (take a look at Wireshark software)
2 – You can send automatic queries to servers, for example automated spam through contact forms works like this. (some spam software can also read Captcha images so you need more protection)
The class I developed will change this POST request to something like this:
POST /somepage.php HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: THE LENGTH

JDF8W9JHF=blah&OEROWF83=blah&VLKDSFOE=some_email
Note that the field names are changed to random strings, and they also change every time the form is shown, so:
1 – Even if a user in the middle can see the packets, he/she won’t know that OEROWF83 stands for “password”.
2 – A spam software won’t have a way of guessing the field names because they are random every time. There is also a secret encryption key which you only know what it is.
